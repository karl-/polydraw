<em>Draw Method Explanations:</em>
<br />
<strong>Continuous</STRONG>
<br />
	- Click and draw.  As long as the mouse is held down, you'll keep adding points.
<br /><br />
<STRONG>Continuous Closing Point</STRONG>
<br />
	- Click and draw, but once you place a point within X distance of the origin point the polygon will finalize. (X is user modifiable, of course!)
<br /><br />
<STRONG>Line Max Vertice</STRONG>
<br />
	- Click to place points, and once the max amount of points has been set (user defined!) the polygon will finalize.
<br /><br />
<STRONG>Line Closing Distance</STRONG>
<br />
	- Similar to Line Max Vertice, except not vertice limit.  Polygon finalizes when a vertice is placed close enough to the origin point.
